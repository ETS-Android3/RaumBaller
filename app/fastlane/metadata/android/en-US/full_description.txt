RaumBaller is an old-school scrolling shoot 'em up game.

You control your spaceship by tapping on the screen.

There are three different available spaceships to choose from, each with their own strengths and
weaknesses.

Your spaceship will shoot automatically, so all you need to focus is on staying alive as long as
possible by avoiding the baddies that want to destroy your ship.

The more enemies you kill, the more your score will go up, and the cannons of your chosen spaceship
will be upgraded automatically.
